# ComputerVision
Shall contain projects I will have tried over time:

1. Canny.py: Implemented an edge detection algorithm called "Canny Edge". 

2. Smooth.py: A program that filters an image thereby making it smoother.

3. Gaussian_Filter.py:  Applying a 5x5 Gaussian kernel onto an image using opencv

4. motion_detector.py: Assuming the initial frame is just the surrouding, when a person enters the scene, the motion is tracked by showing the absolute difference between the intial frame the current frame using Gaussian difference.

5. horizontal_motion.py: Detects the movement along the horizontal direction from a stationary camera.

5. Image_Segmentation.ipynb: Simple image segmentation creating a single/multiple forgeround and background masks.
