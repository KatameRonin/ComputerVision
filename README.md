# ComputerVision
Shall contain projects I will have tried over time:

1. Canny.py: Implemented an edge detection algorithm called "Canny Edge". 

2. Smooth.py: A program that filters an image thereby making it smoother.

3. Gaussian_Filter.py:  Applying a 5x5 Gaussian kernel onto an image using opencv
